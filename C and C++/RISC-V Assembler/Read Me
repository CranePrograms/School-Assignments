This project was the culmination of an entire class on circuits, assembly, and an example of the inner workings of computers.
The actual compiler is simulated using a mixture of C and C++. It attempts to mimic machine instructions in Assembly.
Itâ€™s capable of accurately decoding binary files into machine instructions and then executing those instructions without error.
It has one limitation in that a couple of RISC-V instruction such as e-break were abstracted and simulated or left out altogether.
I do not have the original write up for the assignment but I did get and A on it.
95% of the code was written using the professors RISC-V instruction manual which showed exactly how the computer handled instructions.
We then would take both a diagram usually, and a description and attempt to reproduce the instruction in code.
