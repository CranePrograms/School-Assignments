This project was created for my Operating Systems Class as an exorcise in Threads.
It wasn’t an incredibly long project but it was complicated for someone who had hardly touched the material.
It was written in a combination of C and C++. It involved allowing the user to input an amount of threads, an amount of iterations, and a sentence.
The threads would then attempt to preform their functions limited by the mutex lock that we were to instantiate.
The program could read the sentence and writing the sentence out to console correctly without having any reader/writer issues.
It was not a perfect execution of the idea. It was not required as anything more than extra credit but the program doesn’t make sure that the threads take turns.
So, It’s possible to say read it three times in a row and then write to it once and vice versa.
