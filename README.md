# School-Assignments
A collection of completed Assignments organized by Language
Not every assignment from every class is included here. I picked from both what I still had after losing a computer midway through my academic career, and what I felt was interesting.
School was about 4 years of C++/C work with some other languages interspersed. I of course was taught and worked with other languages in my time at NIU.
